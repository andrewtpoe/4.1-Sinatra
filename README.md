Surf & Paddle as a Sinatra site

This project entails making my weekend project (3.4 - Surf and Paddle) into a fully Sinatra website.

We were introduced to Sinatra in this morning's class at The Iron Yard and were asked to use it to make a live project with multiple pages. We were also asked to use get requests to navigate through those pages.

This site is now responsive, served by Sinatra and includes several additional pages. All of the "Most Popular Posts" at the bottom of the page have corresponding requests. Also, the logo is now a link to the home page.

Future revisions may include making each "post" have a different author that is served up as a part of the locals hash in the app.rb file. This will allow me to practice passing variables down farther than one level in the app.

Please note: All pictures in this site were sourced online and belong to their respective owners. Their use is strictly for educational purposes.
